	Welcome to Equivalent Exchange Records, your home for homebrew and indie media releases. This website is currently under construction, but will be updated slowly as I get time to work on the project. If you've found this by chance and happen to want a run of tapes for your band or project, go ahead and email us at <a href="mailto:contact@equivalentexchangerecords.us">our email</a> and we'll go ahead and get you set up. Thanks!
